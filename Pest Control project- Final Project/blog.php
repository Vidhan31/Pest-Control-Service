                        <p>Termites are a group of insect that mostly feed on dead plant materials, with the ability
                            to digest cellulose. Subterranean termites, the most destructive wooden pest in the
                            world, build their colonies in the soil and usually work their way above ground to reach
                            wood or any other cellulose source. In search for food, subterranean termites will
                            forage into homes from below the ground level right up to the highest point of the roof
                            thrust. Over time, termite damage can become significant on door frames, kitchen
                            cabinets, staircase and wooden flooring.

                        <p>Cockroaches are high-risk pests to have in your home and business premises. From
                            contaminating food and destroying property to causing serious threat to health,
                            cockroach infestations can be especially distressing. Cockroaches creep within corners
                            and difficult spots inside buildings and lay siege, making it very difficult to get rid
                            of them. While DIY cockroach killer solutions can provide temporary relief in the case
                            of low-level infestation, it is only with expert help that you can drive cockroaches out
                            of your house or business premises and prevent re-infiltration in the long run.

                            away for good.
